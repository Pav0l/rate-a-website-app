## Tech stack used

The app is build using React together with Styled-components ðŸ’… and Prop-types. I've utilized new React Hooks API to manage state inside components. Styled-components were used for styling React components and individual HTML elements. I'm also using styling based on props in the "top 3" cards. Prop-types are used for type-checking props passed to components.

HTTP are done via the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

Every rating fetched from back end is rounded to 2 decimal places with a `roundRating` function. Also the `http/https` protocol and `www` are removed from the url string.
